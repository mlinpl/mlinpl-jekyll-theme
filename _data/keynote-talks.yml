    Léon Bottou received the Diplôme d’Ingénieur de l’École Polytechnique (X84) in 1987, the Magistère de Mathématiques Fondamentales et Appliquées et d’Informatique from École Normale Supérieure in 1988, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Université de Paris-Sud in 1991. His research career took him to AT&T Bell Laboratories, AT&T Labs Research, NEC Labs America and Microsoft. He joined Meta AI (formerly Facebook AI Research) in 2015. The long-term goal of Léon Bottou’s research is to understand and replicate intelligence. Because this goal requires conceptual advances that cannot be anticipated, Leon’s research has followed many practical and theoretical turns: neural networks applications in the late 1980s, stochastic gradient learning algorithms and statistical properties of learning systems in the early 1990s, computer vision applications with structured outputs in the late 1990s, theory of large scale learning in the 2000s. During the last few years, Léon Bottou’s research aims to clarify the relation between learning and reasoning, with more and more focus on the many aspects of causation (inference, invariance, reasoning, affordance, and intuition.)

    Volodymyr Mnih is a Research Scientist at Google DeepMind. He completed an MSc at the University of Alberta working under the supervision of Csaba Szepesvari and a PhD at the University of Toronto working under the supervision of Geoffrey Hinton. Since joining DeepMind, he has been working at the intersection of deep learning and reinforcement learning, co-developing Deep Q Networks (DQN), the asynchronous advantage actor critic (A3C), and reinforcement learning-based hard attention mechanisms.
