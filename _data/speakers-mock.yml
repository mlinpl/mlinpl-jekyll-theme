  description: Petar Veličković is a Staff Research Scientist at DeepMind, Affiliated Lecturer at the University of Cambridge, and an Associate of Clare Hall, Cambridge. He holds a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge (Trinity College), obtained under the supervision of Pietro Liò. His research concerns geometric deep learning—devising neural network architectures that respect the invariances and symmetries in data (a topic I’ve co-written a proto-book about). For his contributions, he is recognised as an ELLIS Scholar in the Geometric Deep Learning Program. Particularly, his focus is graph representation learning and its applications in algorithmic reasoning (featured in VentureBeat). He is the first author of Graph Attention Networks—a popular convolutional layer for graphs—and Deep Graph Infomax—a popular self-supervised learning pipeline for graphs (featured in ZDNet). Petar’s research has been used in substantially improving travel-time predictions in Google Maps (featured in the CNBC, Endgadget, VentureBeat, CNET, the Verge and ZDNet), and guiding intuition of mathematicians towards new top-tier theorems and conjectures (featured in Nature, Science, Quanta Magazine, New Scientist, The Independent, Sky News, The Sunday Times, la Repubblica and The Conversation).

  description: Farah Shamout is an Assistant Professor of Computer Engineering at NYU Abu Dhabi, where she leads the Clinical Artificial Intelligence Lab. She is also an Associated Faculty at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering (Computer Science & Engineering and Biomedical Engineering Departments) and an Affiliated Faculty at NYU Langone Health (Radiology). Before pursuing the tenure-track position, Dr. Shamout spent three years at NYU as an Assistant Professor Emerging Scholar, during which she received the Campus Life Faculty Leadership Award in 2021. At the Clinical AI Lab, Dr. Shamout is interested in developing machine learning methods and systems using heterogeneous real-world data for applications in computational precision health. This includes electronic health records data and medical imaging for medical diagnostics and prognostics. Methodologies of interest pertain to multi-modal fusion, representation learning, and augmenting machine and human decision-making, to achieve high performance and utility in clinical practice. Dr. Shamout completed her DPhil (PhD) in Engineering Science at the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar and was a member of Balliol College. Her doctoral research focused on developing early warning models using electronic health records data to predict in-hospital clinical deterioration. While at Oxford, Shamout taught with the inaugural UAE-Oxford Artificial Intelligence Program and worked on global data commons and digital health policy. She also completed her BSc in Computer Engineering (cum laude) at NYU Abu Dhabi
