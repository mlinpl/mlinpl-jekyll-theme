    Henryk Michalewski obtained his Ph.D. in Mathematics and Habilitation in Computer Science from the University of Warsaw. Henryk spent a semester in the Fields Institute, was a postdoc at the Ben Gurion University in Beer-Sheva and a visiting professor in the École normale supérieure de Lyon. He was working on topology, determinacy of games, logic and automata. Then he turned his interests to more practical games and wrote two papers on Morpion Solitaire. Presenting these papers at the IJCAI conference in 2015 he met researchers from DeepMind and discovered the budding field of deep reinforcement learning. This resulted in a series of papers including Learning from memory of Atari 2600, Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Parameters, Distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning: Learn how to play Atari games in 21 minutes and Reinforcement Learning of Theorem Proving.
