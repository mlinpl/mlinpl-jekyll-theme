- title: 'Dancing with censored data: How to survive with explainable survival analysis?'
  date: Sunday / 29 October
  time: TBA
  room: TBA
  desc-md: >-
    As machine learning in survival analysis is gaining popularity, it is becoming crucial for ML practitioners to understand the unique aspects of this type of modeling and effectively interpret survival models.


    This tutorial will guide you through a complete journey of examining the machine learning survival models with explainability and interpretability techniques. You will learn about various methods used for survival model analysis, both from the theoretical perspective and use cases. You will also become familiar with practical tools for creating explanations.


    We will cover explanation techniques developed specifically for survival analysis (SurvSHAP(t), SurvLIME) but also demonstrate how to apply methods adapted from classification and regression problems in this specific field of survival analysis.


    The emphasis will be on the insights these techniques unveil, along with discussions about their limitations, all demonstrated through specially curated examples complemented by code snippets.


    The examples showcased during the tutorial will be mostly prepared using the 'survex' package for the R language. However, survex is capable of creating explanations also for models implemented in Python. Furthermore, a part of the tutorial's examples will be presented in Python, too.

- title: 'Graph representation learning and graph classification'
  date: Sunday / 29 October
  time: TBA
  room: TBA
  desc-md: >-
    Graphs are one of the most general structures that we can process with machine learning. However, as combinatorial and non-Euclidean structures, with unique invariants, they present unique challenges for representation learning. Traditional approaches, such as graph descriptors or graph kernels, focus solely on graph topology. Recent rise of graph neural networks (GNNs) allow us to utilize rich information such as node and edge labels, and include complex subgraph interactions into learned representations. In this tutorial I will outline both classical approaches and modern GNNs. Starting from spectral graph theory, we will introduce the message-passing paradigm, convolutional and attentional GNN architectures. I will focus on graph classification problems, with applications for challenging domains, such as molecular property prediction. Finally, we will introduce the current research problems such as oversmoothing, effective pretraining strategies and fair evaluation.


    **Description and outline:** Tutorial will cover 3 approaches to graph classification: graph invariants (feature engineering), graph kernels and graph neural networks (GNNs). The largest focus will be on the latter. I will start with graph descriptors (invariants), as the most basic, and present classical topological features for graph classification, e.g. with centrality measures or community detection indexes. The example models will be Local Degree Profile (LDP) and Local Topological Profile (LTP), implemented with torch-scatter and networkit, and applied for non-attributed graph classification, e.g. for social networks. For graph kernels, I will present the most well-known topological kernels such as random walk kernel, implemented with GraKeL library and applied for bioinformatics dataset, e.g. proteins. For both of those approaches, I will discuss their advantages and disadvantages, especially in terms of attributed graphs (both nodes and edges), and scalability. For graph neural networks, we will start with Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) as a spectral graph convolution, and then go into the message-passing paradigm with GraphSAGE, GAT and GIN. We will implement them with PyTorch Geometric and apply for molecular property prediction. Lastly, we will review interesting areas of GNN research and development, e.g. oversmoothing (e.g. skip connections, directional message passing), pretraining strategies (e.g. Deep Graph Infomax, graph transformers) and fair evaluation. In general, the tutorial will start from the basics and will not require any specific knowledge apart from undergraduate level mathematics, Python and ML.


    **Goals:** Attendees will learn about graph representation learning approaches, their strengths and weaknesses. In particular, we will focus on GNNs, so they will have a strong foundation for modern methods for graph classification. This can also be applied for node classification, link prediction and other graph-based learning tasks. We will also introduce efficient frameworks, and implement example models.

- title: 'Generative Methods in Drug Discovery: A Practical Introduction'
  date: Sunday / 29 October
  time: TBA
  room: TBA
  desc-md: >-
    The drug discovery process is a search for a compound that possesses a number of properties such as high activity or low toxicity. In recent years, there has been a rapid development of methods for generating potential drugs using neural networks.   During the workshop, we will generate a set of compounds that satisfy a certain set of criteria. We will pay special attention to synthesizability and activity. We will focus on practical techniques that are popular in the drug discovery space.  The workshop goal is to illustrate practical and realistic challenges in generating active molecules. One common issue is that the training data might be limited and noisy, due to the high cost of biological experiments. As such generated compounds might be biased and work poorly in reality.   Another issue is that compounds predicted to be active might be very hard to synthesize. Balancing the ease of synthesis with finding highly active compounds is an ongoing challenge.  During the workshop, we will host a leaderboard for participants to submit and score their generated compounds.


    **Description and outline:** We will cover generating compounds for targets from the TDC leaderboard such as DRD2 using popular techniques (we will likely pick between REINVENT and genetic algorithms). We will host a leaderboard for participants to submit and score their generated compounds.


    **Goals:** We would like attendees to understand what is de novo drug discovery, what are its challenges (e.g. OOD generalization, synthesizability, and many more), and reimplement some rudimentary techniques for generating compounds.

- title: 'What is possible in real-time machine learning?'
  date: Sunday / 29 October

    “The only constant thing in life is change”. A lot of modern data processing applications work with data streams and changing data inputs, and their objective is to provide up-to-date outcomes with low latency at high data throughput.


    In this tutorial, we look at how to design dynamic data processing algorithms in a systematic way, and to implement them in an actual distributed streaming system. A major challenge here is the design of dynamic algorithms ready for different input data scenarios: data streams with insertion, deletion, arrival of data out-of-order, backfilling, etc.


    We center the discussion around designing iterative machine learning algorithms, especially  graph algorithms and nearest neighbor methods for time-changing data. For this task, we provide examples of code in Pathway, a new performant data processing framework, for bounded and unbounded data streams, equipped with a Table API in Python, and powered by a distributed incremental dataflow in Rust.


    In the course of a hands-on code tutorial, we will first show which machine learning algorithms can be implemented to quickly react to training data changes and how they can efficiently keep on updating their answers to the known test cases. We will then use them to design a reactive knowledge base for a Large Language Model chatbot application, showing how it is possible to integrate multiple data sources, learn in real time from its answers, or maintain up-to-date bot answers in the presence of knowledge-base changes.
