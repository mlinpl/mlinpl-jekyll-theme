## Quick-start - running this repo locally

### Install deps

#### Ubuntu:
First setup rbenv according to the official github page: https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv. 
Don't install the version provided in the distro's repo. Follow the official rbenv 
instructions to install the latest Ruby version and set it as the default interpreter.

Now you should be able to run `ruby` and `gem`:
```
$ ruby --version
ruby 3.0.2p107 (2021-07-07 revision 0db68f0233) [x86_64-linux-gnu]
$ gem
3.4.5
```

Now you can run the following in the project's root to install bundler (ruby's version of venv) and the correct gems.
```
gem install jekyll bundler
bundle install
```

#### Mac:
```
brew install chruby ruby-install xz
ruby-install ruby
echo "source $(brew --prefix)/opt/chruby/share/chruby/chruby.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "source $(brew --prefix)/opt/chruby/share/chruby/auto.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "chruby ruby" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc # or restart your session
gem install jekyll bundler
```

Then:
```
bundle install
```

#### Windows:

1. Install RubyInstaller with DevKit from https://rubyinstaller.org/. Follow the step-by-step instructions and install the default components.
2. Open a command prompt or PowerShell window and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following commands:
```
gem install jekyll
gem install bundler -v '2.4.5'
bundle _2.4.5_ install
```
> Note: By default, `bundle install` may try to run a `bundle.js` file in your root directory. If this happens, you may want to move this file temporarily. 

### Run server with livereload
```
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```
This should start the server and make your website available at http://localhost:4000.
